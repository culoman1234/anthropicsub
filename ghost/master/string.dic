//This is the URL where your ghost will look for updates. If you're setting up Network Updates YOU MUST change this to point at the right directory! Otherwise your ghost will not update properly! If you're not going to use the Network Update feature, just leave this section as it is or delete it, it should be fine.

	//Here, you'll notice that there are two names, a --, then a website bracketed by %ASC(1) and %ASC(2). What this will do is randomly chose between those two site names for the link. So if you open the menu, maybe it will say Site Name 1, or maybe it will say Site Name 1 Alternate. Honestly I find links changing names without warning kind of confusing, but maybe some find it amusing, idk. Put the address of the site you want to link to between the two ASC tags.
